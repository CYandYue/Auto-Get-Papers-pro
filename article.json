    "summary": "The Euclid mission of the European Space Agency will deliver galaxy and cosmic shear surveys, which will be used to constrain initial conditions and statistics of primordial fluctuations. We present highlights for the Euclid scientific capability to test initial conditions beyond LCDM with the main probes, i.e. 3D galaxy clustering from the spectroscopic survey, the tomographic approach to 3x2pt statistics from photometric galaxy survey, and their combination. We provide Fisher forecasts from the combination of Euclid spectroscopic and photometric surveys for spatial curvature, running of the spectral index of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations, isocurvature perturbations, and primordial features. For the parameters of these models we also provide the combination of Euclid forecasts (pessimistic and optimistic) with current and future measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies., i.e. Planck, the Simons Observatory (SO), and CMB-S4. We provide Fisher forecasts for how the power spectrum and bispectrum from the Euclid spectroscopic survey will constrain the local, equilateral, and orthogonal shapes of primordial non-Gaussianity. We also review how Bayesian field-level inference of primordial non-Gaussianity can constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity. We show how Euclid, with its unique combination of the main probes, will provide the tightest constraints on low redshift to date. By targeting a markedly different range in redshift and scale, Euclid's expected uncertainties are complementary to those obtained by CMB primary anisotropy, returning the tightest combined constraints on the physics of the early Universe."

    "summary": "Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS, ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in."

    "summary": "We introduce a novel deterministic quantum search algorithm that provides a practical alternative to conventional probabilistic search approaches. Our scheme eliminates the inherent uncertainty of quantum search without relying on arbitrary phase rotations, a key limitation of other deterministic methods. The algorithm achieves certainty by recursively expanding the base oracle so that it marks all states prefixed by the same two bits as the target, encompassing exactly one-quarter of the search space. This enables a step-by-step reduction of the superposition until the target state can be measured with certainty. The algorithm achieves deterministic success with a query complexity of $O(N^{\\log_2(3)/2}) \\approx O(N^{0.7925})$, falling between Grover's $O(\\sqrt{N})$ scaling and the classical $O(N)$. Our approach relies exclusively on two-qubit nearest-neighbour diffusion operators, avoiding global diffusion entirely. We show that, despite the increased query complexity, this design reduces the total number of two-qubit gates required for diffusion by more than an order of magnitude for search spaces up to at least 18 qubits, with even greater advantages on hardware with limited qubit connectivity. The scheme's inherent determinism, reliance on simple nearest-neighbour, low-depth operations, and scalable recursive structure make it well-suited for hardware implementation. Additionally, we show that the algorithm naturally supports partial database search, enabling deterministic identification of selected target bits without requiring a full search, further broadening its applicability."

    "summary": "Household robots have been a longstanding research topic, but they still lack human-like intelligence, particularly in manipulating open-set objects and navigating large environments efficiently and accurately. To push this boundary, we consider a generalized multi-object collection problem in large scene graphs, where the robot needs to pick up and place multiple objects across multiple locations in a long mission of multiple human commands. This problem is extremely challenging since it requires long-horizon planning in a vast action-state space under high uncertainties. To this end, we propose a novel interleaved LLM and motion planning algorithm Inter-LLM. By designing a multimodal action cost similarity function, our algorithm can both reflect the history and look into the future to optimize plans, striking a good balance of quality and efficiency. Simulation experiments demonstrate that compared with latest works, our algorithm improves the overall mission performance by 30% in terms of fulfilling human commands, maximizing mission success rates, and minimizing mission costs."

    "summary": "Climate sensitivity has remained stubbornly uncertain since the Charney Report was published some 45 years ago. Two factors in future climate projections could alter this dilemma: (i) an increased ratio of CO$_2$ forcing relative to aerosol cooling, owing to both continued accumulation of CO$_2$ and declining aerosol emissions, and (ii) a warming world, whereby CO$_2$-induced warming becomes more pronounced relative to climate variability. Here, we develop a novel modeling approach to explore the rates of learning about equilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate response (TCR) and identify the physical drivers underpinning these learning rates. Our approach has the advantage over past work by accounting for the full spectrum of parameter uncertainties and covariances, while also taking into account serially correlated internal climate variability. Moreover, we provide a physical explanation of how quickly we may hope to learn about climate sensitivity. We find that, although we are able to constrain future TCR regardless of the true underlying value, constraining ECS is more difficult, with low values of ECS being more easily ascertained than high values. This asymmetry can be explained by most of the warming this century being attributable to the fast climate mode, which is more useful for constraining TCR than it is for ECS. We further show that our inability to constrain the deep ocean response is what limits our ability to learn high values of ECS."

Leveraging a newly defined notion of homoscedasticity, we develop a conformal prediction algorithm that offers finite-sample coverage guarantees and fast convergence rates of the oracle estimator. In heteroscedastic settings, we forgo these non-asymptotic guarantees to gain statistical efficiency, proposing a local $k$--nearest--neighbor method without conformal calibration that is adaptive to the geometry of each particular nonlinear space. Both procedures work with any regression algorithm and are scalable to large data sets, allowing practitioners to plug in their preferred models and incorporate domain expertise. We prove consistency for the proposed estimators under minimal conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach in personalized--medicine applications involving random response objects such as probability distributions and graph Laplacians."

    "summary": "The interdependence of position and momentum, as highlighted by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, is a cornerstone of quantum physics. Yet, position-momentum correlations have received little systematic attention. Motivated by recent developments in bosonic quantum physics that underscore their relevance in quantum thermodynamics, metrology, and computing, we establish a general framework to study and quantify position-momentum correlations in quantum states. We introduce symplectic coherence, a faithful and easily computable measure defined as the Frobenius norm of the block of the covariance matrix encoding position-momentum correlations, and demonstrate that symplectic coherence is monotone under relevant operations and robust under small perturbations. Furthermore, using a recent mapping by Barthe et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 070604) which relates the covariance matrix of a bosonic state to the density matrix of a finite-dimensional system, we show that position-momentum correlations correspond to beyond-classical correlations in a virtual finite-dimensional quantum state, with symplectic coherence mapping naturally to geometric quantum discord. Taking energy constraints into account, we determine the maximal position-momentum correlations achievable at fixed energy, revealing structural insights about the corresponding optimal states. Finally, we illustrate the operational relevance of symplectic coherence through several examples in quantum information tasks and quantum thermodynamics. In the process, we establish new technical results on matrix norms and quantum covariance matrices, and demonstrate the conceptual significance of viewing covariance matrices as density matrices of virtual quantum states."

In our model, each agent can either rent at a fixed daily cost, or purchase a pass at an individual cost, with an additional third option of a discounted group pass available to all. We consider scenarios in which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop out of the decision process. To address this problem from different perspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall, state-dependent, and individual rational. For each objective, we design and analyze optimal deterministic and randomized policies. Our deterministic policies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic states, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from tailored state-aware distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric policies, in which all agents use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric ones. Our results provide competitive ratio upper and lower bounds and extend classical ski-rental insights to multi-agent settings, highlighting both theoretical and practical implications for group decision-making under uncertainty."

The measurements showed that hydrogen diffusion in ferrite is slowed significantly by the presence of fine (<5 nm) (Ti,Cr)C particles; coarser particles had little or no effect. The TDS measurements were consistent with hydrogen traps with a high energy barrier. The uniqueness of the hydrogen trapping parameters obtained using the fitting procedure was evaluated. It was found that the system was overdetermined; the measurements could be fitted with multiple combinations of trapping parameters. Consequently, it was not possible to determine the individual trapping parameters using this procedure. Trapping parameters were also evaluated from TDS measurements by applying Kissinger's equation. Using this procedure a trap binding energy of 0.24 eV was calculated for all materials, albeit with a high degree of uncertainty."

    "summary": "We demonstrate that final-state uncertainty is ubiquitous in multistable systems of coupled neuronal maps, meaning that predicting whether one such system will eventually be chaotic or nonchaotic is often nearly impossible. We propose a \"chance synchronization\" mechanism that governs the emergence of unpredictability in neuron systems and support it by using basin classification, uncertainty exponent, and basin entropy techniques to analyze five simple discrete-time systems, each consisting of a different neuron model. Our results illustrate that uncertainty in neuron systems is not just a product of noise or high-dimensional complexity; it is also a fundamental property of low-dimensional, deterministic models, which has profound implications for understanding brain function, modeling cognition, and interpreting unpredictability in general multistable systems."

This provides an independent, lensing-based calibration of halo masses, complementary to methods relying on clustering or dynamics. We derive constraints on the mean halo mass for three DESI-selected samples, finding $\\log(M_{\\rm halo}/(M_\\odot/h)) \\approx 13.18$, 13.03 and 13.02 for the Main LRG, Extended LRG, and BGS samples, respectively. Using a halo model approach, we also compare the projected galaxy-matter density profiles with previously reported gas profiles inferred from measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. This work addresses one of the key uncertainties in interpreting kSZ signals -- the unknown host halo mass distribution -- by providing an independent and consistent mass calibration. The agreement between the gas and total mass profiles at large aperture suggests that sufficiently far from the group center (2--3 virial radii), we recover all the baryons, offering a resolution to the 'missing baryon' problem. We further study the cumulative gas fractions for all galaxies as well as for the most massive galaxy groups in the sample ($\\log(M_{\\rm halo}/(M_\\odot/h)) \\approx 13.5$), finding values that are physically sensible and in agreement with previous findings using kSZ and X-ray data: compared to the TNG300 simulation, the observed gas fractions are systematically lower at fixed radius by $\\gtrsim$4$\\sigma$, providing compelling, independent evidence for stronger baryonic feedback in the real Universe. These findings highlight the power of combining CMB lensing with galaxy surveys to probe the interplay between baryons and dark matter in group-sized halos."

    "summary": "The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a universal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to new revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics. Multiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way symmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we investigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries, namely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN) approaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the effective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by expectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic approach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical algebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all three formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that these three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished by sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two approaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including relativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF transformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the older effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application, we explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out to be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and algebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally, we pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by studying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters formalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states."

While machine learning (ML) methods have improved the ability to model uncertainty caused by loads and renewables, accurately integrating these forecasts and their sensitivities into steady-state analyses and decision-making strategies remains an open challenge. Toward this goal, we present a generalized methodology that seamlessly embeds ML-based forecasting engines within physics-based power flow and grid optimization tools. By coupling physics-based grid modeling with black-box ML methods, we accurately capture the behavior and sensitivity of loads and weather events by directly integrating the inputs and outputs of trained ML forecasting models into the numerical methods of power flow and grid optimization. Without fitting surrogate load models, our approach obtains the sensitivities directly from data to accurately predict the response of forecasted devices to changes in the grid. Our approach combines the sensitivities of forecasted devices attained via backpropagation and the sensitivities of physics-defined grid devices. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by showcasing improvements in sensitivity calculations and leveraging them to design a robust power dispatch that improves grid reliability under stochastic weather events. Our approach enables the computation of system sensitivities to exogenous factors which supports broader analyses that improve grid reliability in the presence of load variability and extreme weather conditions."

Current approaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect localized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a global-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity and then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach employs evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding the extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression mechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement strategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate both contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three CT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our analysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial benefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive learning pipeline is implemented.

Current motion planning methods often fail to effectively utilize prior motion experiences and adapt to real-time uncertainties inherent in underwater settings. In this paper, we introduce an Adaptive Heuristic Motion Planner framework that integrates a Heuristic Motion Space (HMS) with Bayesian Networks to enhance motion planning for autonomous underwater manipulation. Our approach employs the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) algorithm within HMS to optimize paths by minimizing a composite cost function that accounts for distance, uncertainty, energy consumption, and execution time. By leveraging HMS, our framework significantly reduces the search space, thereby boosting computational performance and enabling real-time planning capabilities. Bayesian Networks are utilized to dynamically update uncertainty estimates based on real-time sensor data and environmental conditions, thereby refining the joint probability of path success. Through extensive simulations and real-world test scenarios, we showcase the advantages of our method in terms of enhanced performance and robustness. This probabilistic approach significantly advances the capability of autonomous underwater robots, ensuring optimized motion planning in the face of dynamic marine challenges."

Matter accretion from the disk is also thought to power gamma ray-bursts. We discover from numerical relativity simulations that the accretion disk influences the ringdown gravitational-wave signal produced by binaries that promptly collapse to black-hole at merger. We propose a method to \\emph{directly} measure the mass of the accretion disk left during black hole formation in binary mergers using observatories such as the Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer with a relative error of 10\\% for binaries at a distance of up to 30~Mpc, corresponding to an event rate of 0.001 to 0.25 events per year."

    "summary": "Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning, revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably, persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps. Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap. Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks."

However, persistent challenges like hallucinations and operational brittleness limit their autonomous use, creating a critical need for robust frameworks to guide human-AI collaboration. Drawing on established Human-AI teaming research and analogies from fields like autonomous driving, this paper develops a structured taxonomy of human-agent interaction. Based on case study research within technical support platforms, we propose a six-mode taxonomy that organizes collaboration across a spectrum of AI autonomy. This spectrum is anchored by the Human-Out-of-the-Loop (HOOTL) model for full automation and the Human-Augmented Model (HAM) for passive AI assistance. Between these poles, the framework specifies four distinct intermediate structures. These include the Human-in-Command (HIC) model, where AI proposals re-quire mandatory human approval, and the Human-in-the-Process (HITP) model for structured work-flows with deterministic human tasks. The taxonomy further delineates the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) model, which facilitates agent-initiated escalation upon uncertainty, and the Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL) model, which enables discretionary human oversight of an autonomous AI. The primary contribution of this work is a comprehensive framework that connects this taxonomy to key contingency factors -- such as task complexity, operational risk, and system reliability -- and their corresponding conceptual architectures. By providing a systematic method for selecting and designing an appropriate level of human oversight, our framework offers practitioners a crucial tool to navigate the trade-offs between automation and control, thereby fostering the development of safer, more effective, and context-aware technical service systems."

A major source of modeling uncertainty lies in astrophysical processes associated with galaxy formation and evolution, which remain poorly understood. Probes such as the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, X-rays, and dispersion measure from fast radio bursts offer a promising avenue for mapping the distribution and thermal properties of cosmic baryons. A unified analytical framework capable of jointly modeling these observables is essential for fully harnessing the complementary information while mitigating probe-specific systematics. In this work, we present a detailed assessment of existing analytical models, which differ in their assumptions and prescriptions for simultaneously describing the distribution of matter and baryons in the universe. Using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation, we test these models by jointly analyzing the 3D auto- and cross-power spectra of the matter and baryonic fields that underpin the above probes. We find that all models can reproduce the power spectra at sub-percent to few-percent accuracy, depending on the tracer combination and number of free parameters. Their ability to recover underlying halo properties, such as the evolution of gas abundance and thermodynamic profiles with halo mass, varies considerably. Our results suggest that these models require further refinement and testing for reliable interpretation of multi-wavelength datasets."

In this work, we perform a systematic study to test the validity of the eikonal approximation for nucleon-nucleus reactions. We also quantify uncertainties due to the nucleon optical potential on reaction observables. We inspect the validity of the eikonal model and its semiclassical correction by comparing it to exact solutions (obtained from solving the optical model equation with a finite differences method) for a wide range of reactions. We also study the effect of relativistic corrections, both kinematic and dynamic, by effectively incorporating the relativistic effects at intermediate energies. The uncertainties from a Bayesian global optical potential (KDUQ) are propagated to the observables of interest. Our study includes neutron and proton reactions on $^{27}$Al, $^{40}$Ca, $^{90}$Zr and $^{208}$Pb, for a wide range of energies $E_{lab}=0-400$ MeV. Our results show that for the proton absorption cross section, the eikonal model can be used down to around $60$ MeV and the semiclassical correction extends its use to $30$ MeV. However, the validity of the eikonal model for the neutron total cross section only goes down to $\\approx120$ MeV, a range extended to $\\approx 50$ MeV when using the semiclassical correction. We find the semi-classical correction to the eikonal model to be less effective in describing the angular distributions. The $1\\sigma$ uncertainty intervals on the observables we studied is less than $5$% for most of the energies considered, but increases rapidly for higher energies, namely energies outside the range of KDUQ ($E_{lab}>200$ MeV)."

Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse X-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed characterisation. We obtained new XMM-Newton observations, and produced count-rate images, equivalent width and median photon energy maps to identify optimal regions for spectral analysis. We complemented these observations with a reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo observations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is well described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT \\sim 0.15 keV, mildly under-solar N and o abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3. According to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kya old and lies at a distance of 4-5 kpc. A distinti \"Clump\" region shows hared emission equally well described by a thermal (kT\\sim 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma \\sim 2.7). The brightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an isolated Alpha filament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in a tenuous medium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind activity of the massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is consistent within the uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming that this peculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high above the Galactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy morphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments indicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though a mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded"

    "summary": "Derivative computation is a key component of optimization, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, and nonlinear solvers. Automatic differentiation (AD) is a powerful technique for evaluating such derivatives, and in recent years, has been integrated into programming environments such as Jax, PyTorch, and TensorFlow to support derivative computations needed for training of machine learning models, resulting in widespread use of these technologies. The C++ language has become the de facto standard for scientific computing due to numerous factors, yet language complexity has made the adoption of AD technologies for C++ difficult, hampering the incorporation of powerful differentiable programming approaches into C++ scientific simulations. This is exacerbated by the increasing emergence of architectures such as GPUs, which have limited memory capabilities and require massive thread-level concurrency. Portable scientific codes rely on domain specific programming models such as Kokkos making AD for such codes even more complex. In this paper, we will investigate source transformation-based automatic differentiation using Clad to automatically generate portable and efficient gradient computations of Kokkos-based code. We discuss the modifications of Clad required to differentiate Kokkos abstractions. We will illustrate the feasibility of our proposed strategy by comparing the wall-clock time of the generated gradient code with the wall-clock time of the input function on different cutting edge GPU architectures such as NVIDIA H100, AMD MI250x, and Intel Ponte Vecchio GPU. For these three architectures and for the considered example, evaluating up to 10 000 entries of the gradient only took up to 2.17x the wall-clock time of evaluating the input function."

    "summary": "The azimuthal-correlation distributions between electrons from the decays of heavy-flavor hadrons and associated charged particles in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are reported for the 0-10% and 30-50% centrality classes. This is the first measurement to provide access to the azimuthal-correlation observables in the heavy-flavor sector in Pb-Pb collisions. The analysis is performed for trigger electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays with transverse momentum $4 < p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm e} < 16$ GeV/$c$, considering associated particles within the transverse-momentum range $1 < p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm assoc} < 7$ GeV/$c$, and a pseudorapidity difference of $|\\Delta\\eta| < 1$ between the trigger electron and associated particles. The per-trigger nuclear modification factor ($I_{\\rm AA}$) is calculated to compare the near- and away-side peak yields to those in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV. In 0-10% central collisions, the $I_{\\rm AA}$ indicates a hint of enhancement of associated-particle yields with $p_{\\rm T} < 3$ GeV/$c$ on the near side, and a suppression of yields with $p_{\\rm T} > 4$ GeV/$c$ on the away side. The $I_{\\rm AA}$ for electron triggers from heavy-flavor hadron decays is compared with that for light-flavor and strange-particle triggers to investigate the dependence on different fragmentation processes and parton-medium dynamics, and is found to be the same within uncertainties."

Measurements are performed via the newly accessed decay channel $\\overline{\\Sigma}^{\\pm} \\rightarrow {\\rm\\overline{n}}\\pi^{\\pm}$. A new method of antineutron reconstruction with the PHOS electromagnetic spectrometer is developed and applied to this analysis. The $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra of $\\overline{\\Sigma}^{\\pm}$ are measured in the range $0.5 < p_{\\rm T} < 3$ GeV/$c$ and compared to predictions of the PYTHIA 8, DPMJET, PHOJET, EPOS LHC and EPOS4 models. The EPOS LHC and EPOS4 models provide the best descriptions of the measured spectra both in pp and p-Pb collisions, while models which do not account for multiparton interactions provide a considerably worse description at high $p_{\\rm T}$. The total yields of $\\overline{\\Sigma}^{\\pm}$ in both pp and p-Pb collisions are compared to predictions of the Thermal-FIST model and dynamical models PYTHIA 8, DPMJET, PHOJET, EPOS LHC and EPOS4. All models reproduce the total yields in both colliding systems within uncertainties. The nuclear modification factors $R_{\\rm pPb}$ for both $\\overline{\\Sigma}^{+}$ and $\\overline{\\Sigma}^{-}$ are evaluated and compared to those of protons, $\\Lambda$ and $\\Xi$ hyperons, and predictions of EPOS LHC and EPOS4 models. No deviations of $R_{\\rm pPb}$ for $\\overline{\\Sigma}^{\\pm}$ from the model predictions or measurements for other hadrons are found within uncertainties."

    "summary": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models. Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight the potential of our framework for BCI applications."

    "summary": "Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images. A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it. Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets."

    "summary": "Predicting the behavior of complex systems in engineering often involves significant uncertainty about operating conditions, such as external loads, environmental effects, and manufacturing variability. As a result, uncertainty quantification (UQ) has become a critical tool in modeling-based engineering, providing methods to identify, characterize, and propagate uncertainty through computational models. However, the stochastic nature of UQ typically requires numerous evaluations of these models, which can be computationally expensive and limit the scope of feasible analyses. To address this, surrogate models, i.e., efficient functional approximations trained on a limited set of simulations, have become central in modern UQ practice. This book chapter presents a concise review of surrogate modeling techniques for UQ, with a focus on the particularly challenging task of capturing the full time-dependent response of dynamical systems. It introduces a classification of time-dependent problems based on the complexity of input excitation and discusses corresponding surrogate approaches, including combinations of principal component analysis with polynomial chaos expansions, time warping techniques, and nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX models). Each method is illustrated with simple application examples to clarify the underlying ideas and practical use."

    "summary": "The transport of chemical elements in stellar interiors is one of the greatest sources of uncertainties of solar and stellar modelling. The Sun, with its exquisite spectroscopic, helioseismic and neutrino observations, offers a prime environment to test the prescriptions used for both microscopic and macroscopic transport processes. We study in detail the impact of various formalisms for atomic diffusion on helioseismic constraints in both CLES (Scuflaire et al., 2008a) and Cesam2k2 (Morel and Lebreton 2008; Marques et al. 2013; Deal et al. 2018) models and compare both codes in detail. Moreover, due to the inability of standard models using microscopic diffusion to reproduce light element depletion in the Sun (Li, Be), another efficient process must be included to reproduce these constraints (rotation-induced: Eggenberger et al. 2022, overshooting -- or penetrative convection -- below the convective envelope: Th\\'evenin et al. 2017, or ad hoc turbulence: Lebreton and Maeder 1987; Richer, Michaud, and Turcotte 2000). However, introducing such an extra mixing leads to issues with the CNO neutrino fluxes (see Buldgen et al. 2023), which seem to be systematically lower than the Borexino observations (Appel et al., 2022. Another key aspect to consider when reconciling models with neutrino fluxes is the impact of electronic screening (Mussack and D\\\"appen, 2011)."

This thesis starts with the introduction and background on how to formally think about uncertainty in the domain of classical states. The concept of probability vector majorization and its variants, relative majorization and conditional majorization, are reviewed. This thesis introduces three conceptually distinct approaches to formalize the notion of uncertainty inherent in classical channels. These three approaches define the same preordering on the domain of classical channels, leading to characterizations from many perspectives. With the solid foundation of uncertainty comparison, classical channel entropy is then defined to be an additive monotone with respect to the majorization relation. The well-known entropies in the domain of classical states are uniquely extended to the domain of channels via the optimal extensions, providing not only a solid foundation but also the quantifiers of uncertainty inherent in classical channels."

High levels of CPU can slow down investments in green technologies, make regulatory planning more difficult, and increase public resistance to climate reforms, especially during times of economic stress. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting the US CPU index by building the Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model with a large set of covariates, including economic indicators, financial cycle data, and public sentiments captured through Google Trends. The key strength of the BSTS model lies in its ability to efficiently manage a large number of covariates through its dynamic feature selection mechanism based on the spike-and-slab prior. To validate the effectiveness of the selected features of the BSTS model, an impulse response analysis is performed. The results show that macro-financial shocks impact CPU in different ways over time. Numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the BSTS model with exogenous variables on the US CPU dataset over different forecasting horizons. The empirical results confirm that BSTS consistently outperforms classical and deep learning frameworks, particularly for semi-long-term and long-term forecasts."

However, they often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure. Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset."

Real-world data often contain imperfections, characterized by uncertainty and imprecision, which are not well handled by traditional methods. Evidential clustering, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, addresses these challenges. This paper explores the underexplored problem of explaining evidential clustering results, which is crucial for high-stakes domains such as healthcare. Our analysis shows that, in the general case, representativity is a necessary and sufficient condition for decision trees to serve as abductive explainers. Building on the concept of representativity, we generalize this idea to accommodate partial labeling through utility functions. These functions enable the representation of \"tolerable\" mistakes, leading to the definition of evidential mistakeness as explanation cost and the construction of explainers tailored to evidential classifiers. Finally, we propose the Iterative Evidential Mistake Minimization (IEMM) algorithm, which provides interpretable and cautious decision tree explanations for evidential clustering functions. We validate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real-world data. Taking into account the decision-maker's preferences, we were able to provide an explanation that was satisfactory up to 93% of the time."

    "summary": "This article addresses the challenge of adapting data-based models over time. We propose a novel two-fold modelling architecture designed to correct plant-model mismatch caused by two types of uncertainty. Out-of-domain uncertainty arises when the system operates under conditions not represented in the initial training dataset, while in-domain uncertainty results from real-world variability and flaws in the model structure or training process. To handle out-of-domain uncertainty, a slow learning component, inspired by the human brain's slow thinking process, learns system dynamics under unexplored operating conditions, and it is activated only when a monitoring strategy deems it necessary. This component consists of an ensemble of models, featuring (i) a combination rule that weights individual models based on the statistical proximity between their training data and the current operating condition, and (ii) a monitoring algorithm based on statistical control charts that supervises the ensemble's reliability and triggers the offline training and integration of a new model when a new operating condition is detected. To address in-domain uncertainty, a fast learning component, inspired by the human brain's fast thinking process, continuously compensates in real time for the mismatch of the slow learning model. This component is implemented as a Gaussian process (GP) model, trained online at each iteration using recent data while discarding older samples. The proposed methodology is tested on a benchmark energy system referenced in the literature, demonstrating that the combined use of slow and fast learning components improves model accuracy compared to standard adaptation approaches."

We solve this problem by embedding canonical forms of LTI systems within the Bayesian framework. We rigorously establish that inference in these minimal parameterizations fully captures all invariant system dynamics (e.g., transfer functions, eigenvalues, predictive distributions of system outputs) while resolving identifiability. This approach unlocks the use of meaningful, structure-aware priors (e.g., enforcing stability via eigenvalues) and ensures conditions for a Bernstein--von Mises theorem -- a link between Bayesian and frequentist large-sample asymptotics that is broken in standard forms. Extensive simulations with modern MCMC methods highlight advantages over standard parameterizations: canonical forms achieve higher computational efficiency, generate interpretable and well-behaved posteriors, and provide robust uncertainty estimates, particularly from limited data."

However, it is challenging for computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization. Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical."

    "summary": "Solving chance-constrained optimal control problems for systems subject to non-stationary uncertainties is a significant challenge.Conventional robust model predictive control (MPC) often yields excessive conservatism by relying on static worst-case assumptions, while standard stochastic MPC methods struggle when underlying uncertainty distributions are unknown a priori.This article presents a Risk-Aware Adaptive Robust MPC (RAAR-MPC) framework,a hierarchical architecture that systematically orchestrates a novel synthesis of proactive, learning-based risk assessment and reactive risk regulation. The framework employs a medium-frequency risk assessment engine, which leverages Gaussian process regression and active learning, to construct a tight, data-driven characterization of the prediction error set from operational data.Concurrently, a low-timescale outer loop implements a self-correcting update law for an adaptive safety margin to precisely regulate the empirical risk and compensate for unmodeled dynamics.This dual-timescale adaptation enables the system to rigorously satisfy chance constraints with a user-defined probability, while minimizing the conservatism inherent in traditional approaches.We formally establish that the interplay between these adaptive components guarantees recursive feasibility and ensures the closed-loop system satisfies the chance constraints up to a user-defined risk level with high probability.Numerical experiments on a benchmark DC-DC converter under non-stationary parametric uncertainties demonstrate that our framework precisely achieves the target risk level, resulting in a significantly lower average cost compared to state-of-the-art robust and stochastic MPC strategies."

    "summary": "We study the joint power allocation and reflecting element (RE) activation to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) in communication systems assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), taking into account imperfections in channel state information (CSI). The robust optimization problem is mixed integer, i.e., the optimization variables are continuous (transmit power) and discrete (binary states of REs). In order to solve this challenging problem we develop two algorithms. The first one is an alternating optimization (AO) method that attains a suboptimal solution with low complexity, based on the Lambert W function and a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The second one is a branch-and-bound (B&B) method that uses AO as its subroutine and is formally guaranteed to achieve a globally optimal solution. Both algorithms do not require any external optimization solver for their implementation. Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline schemes, AO achieves near-optimal performance in most cases, and B&B has low computational complexity on average."

We perform an exact next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation within the $q_T$-subtraction formalism and validate it against an independent computation in the dipole subtraction scheme. Non-resonant and off-shell effects related to the top quarks and the leptonic decays of the $W^\\pm$ bosons are consistently included. We also consider the approximation in which the real-emission contribution is computed exactly while the virtual is evaluated in the double-pole approximation (DPA), which formally requires the inclusion of both factorisable and non-factorisable corrections. We evaluate such contributions and show that the DPA performs remarkably well at both the inclusive and differential levels. We then extend our calculation to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). All tree-level and one-loop amplitudes are evaluated exactly, while the missing two-loop virtual contribution is estimated using the DPA. The factorisable two-loop corrections are explicitly computed by relying on available results for the polarised two-loop on-shell top-quark pair production amplitudes and the corresponding top-quark decays. The non-factorisable contributions are inferred by exploiting the cancellation of logarithmic singularities in the $\\Gamma_t\\to 0$ limit through an on-shell matching procedure. The NNLO corrections for the inclusive cross section are found to increase the NLO prediction by approximately $11\\%$, with a numerical uncertainty that is conservatively estimated to be below the $2\\%$ level $\\unicode{x2013}$ significantly smaller than the $5\\%$ residual perturbative uncertainties."

    "summary": "A methodology is developed, based on nonparametric Bayesian dictionary learning, for joint space-time wind field data extrapolation and estimation of related statistics by relying on limited/incomplete measurements. Specifically, utilizing sparse/incomplete measured data, a time-dependent optimization problem is formulated for determining the expansion coefficients of an associated low-dimensional representation of the stochastic wind field. Compared to an alternative, standard, compressive sampling treatment of the problem, the developed methodology exhibits the following advantages. First, the Bayesian formulation enables also the quantification of the uncertainty in the estimates. Second, the requirement in standard CS-based applications for an a priori selection of the expansion basis is circumvented. Instead, this is done herein in an adaptive manner based on the acquired data. Overall, the methodology exhibits enhanced extrapolation accuracy, even in cases of high-dimensional data of arbitrary form, and of relatively large extrapolation distances. Thus, it can be used, potentially, in a wide range of wind engineering applications where various constraints dictate the use of a limited number of sensors. The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated by considering two case studies. The first relates to the extrapolation of simulated wind velocity records consistent with a prescribed joint wavenumber-frequency power spectral density in a three-dimensional domain (2D and time). The second pertains to the extrapolation of four-dimensional (3D and time) boundary layer wind tunnel experimental data that exhibit significant spatial variability and non-Gaussian characteristics."

Here, we present the final quasar catalogue, including redshift estimates, from the miniJPAS Data Release constructed using several flavours of machine-learning algorithms. Methods. In this work, we use a machine learning algorithm to classify quasars, optimally combining the output of 8 individual algorithms. We assess the relative importance of the different classifiers. We include results from 3 different redshift estimators to also provide improved photometric redshifts. We compare our final catalogue against both simulated data and real spectroscopic data. Our main comparison metric is the $f_1$ score, which balances the catalogue purity and completeness. Results. We evaluate the performance of the combined algorithm using synthetic data. In this scenario, the combined algorithm outperforms the rest of the codes, reaching $f_1=0.88$ and $f_1=0.79$ for high- and low-z quasars (with $z\\geq2.1$ and $z<2.1$, respectively) down to magnitude $r=23.5$. We further evaluate its performance against real spectroscopic data, finding different performances. We conclude that our simulated data is not realistic enough and that a new version of the mocks would improve the performance. Our redshift estimates on mocks suggest a typical uncertainty of $\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD} =0.11$, which, according to our results with real data, could be significantly smaller (as low as $\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD}=0.02$).

Recent works like van Krieken et al. (2024) and Marconato et al. (2024) argued that the independence assumption can hinder learning of NeSy predictors and, more crucially, prevent them from correctly modelling uncertainty. There is, however, scepticism in the NeSy community around the scenarios in which the independence assumption actually limits NeSy systems (Faronius and Dos Martires, 2025). In this work, we settle this question by formally showing that assuming independence among symbolic concepts entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over certain concept combinations. Thus, the model fails to be aware of reasoning shortcuts, i.e., the pathological behaviour of NeSy predictors that predict correct downstream tasks but for the wrong reasons."

    "summary": "Logistics operators, from battlefield coordinators rerouting airlifts ahead of a storm to warehouse managers juggling late trucks, often face life-critical decisions that demand both domain expertise and rapid and continuous replanning. While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics plans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume an idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for uncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle uncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to entry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety and cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility of natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation. It converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies its own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive clarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A lightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples, surpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency by nearly 50%. These preliminary results highlight a practical path toward certifiable, real-time, and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics."

This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, as if chatting face-to-face with a real person. However, this poses significant challenges to latency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving very little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty and instability, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI from being like a real person. To address this, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented Real-time Communication framework, exploring the network requirement shift from \"humans watching video\" to \"AI understanding video\". To reduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose Context-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video region for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important regions. To avoid packet retransmission, we propose Loss-Resilient Adaptive Frame Rate that leverages previous frames to substitute for lost/delayed frames while avoiding bitrate waste. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality on MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions and ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat."

With this corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase question frequency and relevancy."

    "summary": "Conformal prediction is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method that has gained popularity in the machine learning community due to its finite-sample guarantees and ease of use. Its most common variant, dubbed split conformal prediction, is also computationally efficient as it boils down to collecting statistics of the model predictions on some calibration data not yet seen by the model. Nonetheless, these guarantees only hold if the calibration and test data are exchangeable, a condition that is difficult to verify and often violated in practice due to so-called distribution shifts. The literature is rife with methods to mitigate the loss in coverage in this non-exchangeable setting, but these methods require some prior information on the type of distribution shift to be expected at test time. In this work, we study this problem via a new perspective, through the lens of optimal transport, and show that it is possible to estimate the loss in coverage and mitigate it in case of distribution shift."

These rates shape the stellar structure and evolution, and impact the nature of the final compact remnant. We explore the impact of new nuclear reaction rates for 12C({\\alpha},{\\gamma})16O, 12C+12C, 12C+16O and 16O+16O reactions for massive stars. We aim to investigate how the structure and nucleosynthesis evolve and how these processes influence the stellar fate. We computed stellar models using the GENEC code, including updated rates for 12C({\\alpha},{\\gamma})16O and, for the three fusion reactions, new rates following a fusion suppression scenario and new theoretical rates obtained with TDHF calculations. The updated 12C({\\alpha},{\\gamma})16O rates mainly impact the chemical structure evolution changing the 12C/16O ratio with little effect on the CO core mass. This variation in the 12C/16O ratio is critical for predicting the stellar fate, which is very sensitive to 12C abundance. The combined new rates for 12C+12C and 16O+16O fusion reactions according to the HIN(RES) model lead to shorter C- and O-burning lifetimes, and shift the ignition conditions to higher temperatures and densities. Theoretical TDHF rates primarily affect C-burning, increasing its duration and lowering the ignition temperature. These changes alter the core chemical structure, the carbon shell size and duration, and hence the compactness. They also affect nucleosynthesis. This work shows that accurate reaction rates for key processes in massive star evolution drive significant changes in stellar burning lifetimes, chemical evolution, and stellar fate. In addition, discrepancies between experimental and theoretical rates introduce uncertainties in model predictions, influencing both the internal structure and the supernova ejecta composition."

    "summary": "Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also, it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Our approach is based on Stochastic Variational Gaussian Process Regression (SVGPR) and provides an attractive alternative to binning procedures. SVGPR is an approximation to standard GPR, the latter of which suffers severe computational scaling with N and assumes independently distributed Gaussian Noise. In the Galaxy however, velocity measurements exhibit scatter from both observational uncertainty and the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the distribution function. We exploit the factorization property of the objective function in SVGPR to simultaneously model both the mean velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor as separate Gaussian Processes. This achieves a computational complexity of O(M^3) versus GPR's O(N^3), where M << N is a subset of points chosen in a principled way to summarize the data. Applied to a sample of ~8 x 10^5 stars from the Gaia DR3 Radial Velocity Survey, we construct differentiable profiles of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion as functions of height above the Galactic midplane. We find asymmetric features in all three diagonal components of the velocity dispersion tensor, providing evidence that the vertical dynamics of the Milky Way are in a state of disequilibrium. Furthermore, our dispersion profiles exhibit correlated structures at several locations in |z|, which we interpret as signatures of the Gaia phase spiral. These results demonstrate that our method provides a promising direction for data-driven analyses of Galactic dynamics."

Here we present a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral analysis based on new UV and archival optical spectra of one of the hottest PG 1159 stars, $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$. We find $T_\\text{eff} = 175$ kK and a surface gravity of log $g = 7.7$, and an astonishingly low O/C ratio of $7.3 \\times 10^{-3}$ by mass. By combining the spectroscopic surface gravity and Gaia parallax with a spectral energy distribution fit, we derive a mass of $M_\\text{spec} = 1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7}$ $M_\\odot$. Although this spectroscopic mass is higher than predicted by evolutionary models, it is subject to substantial uncertainty. Furthermore, we find that $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$ shows strongly rotationally broadened lines, suggesting that the previously reported photometric period of $41$ min indeed corresponds to the rotational period of this star. Our kinematic analysis shows that $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$ belongs to the Galactic halo, which - assuming single-star evolution - is in stark contrast to its relatively high mass. The rapid rotation, high mass, and halo kinematics, as well as the lack of evidence for a close companion, lead us to believe that $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$ formed through the merger of two white dwarfs.

The main difference from recent studies is utilisation of a graph-based approach in reservoir modelling instead of the more traditional lattice-based deep learning methods. We provide a solution to implicitly control the geological realism through the latent variables of a generative model and Geodesic metrics. Our experiments of AHM with synthetic dataset that consists of 3D realisations of channelised geological representations with two distinct scenarios with one and two channels shows the viability of the approach. We offer in-depth analysis of the latent space using tools such as PCA, t-SNE, and TDA to illustrate its structure."

    "summary": "This paper proposes a novel hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) framework, called the Parent-Child MPC architecture, to steer nonlinear systems under uncertainty towards a target set, balancing computational complexity and guaranteeing recursive feasibility and stability without relying on conservative terminal constraints in online decision-making. By coupling a small-horizon Child MPC layer with one or more large-horizon Parent MPC layers, the architecture ensures recursive feasibility and stability through adjustable stage-wise constraints derived from tube-based control. As is demonstrated in our case studies, compared to traditional MPC methods, the proposed Parent-Child MPC architecture enhances performance and computational efficiency, reduces conservativeness, and enables scalable planning for certain nonlinear systems."
